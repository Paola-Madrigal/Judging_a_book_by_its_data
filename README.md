One of the best/most-nurturing hobbies one can have is reading books. However, it is not easy for everyone to just pick up a book and start reading it. I believe that not all books are for everyone, and our likes and dislikes play an important roll on whether we will start (and finish) a certain book. The intent of this article is to analyze the most trendy books of the 21st Century, and what features will determine if a book is succesfull or not.
